  "summary": "A Finance department user received a phishing email with a macro-enabled Word document. The user opened the attachment, which triggered PowerShell to execute an encoded command attempting to download a payload from a known malicious C2 server associated with FIN7.",
  "risk_score": 9,
  "risk_reasoning": "High risk due to: (1) Confirmed execution chain from email attachment to PowerShell, (2) C2 domain matches known FIN7 infrastructure with 78% confidence, (3) Target user is in Finance with access to sensitive financial data, (4) Asset criticality is high. This appears to be an active compromise requiring immediate containment.",
