SOC Copilot is an LLM-powered Security Operations Center triage tool designed to accelerate alert investigation and reduce analyst fatigue. Built on Azure OpenAI (GPT-4o), it provides:
	∙	Intelligent alert summarization — Translates complex security alerts into plain-language summaries with risk scoring
	∙	Contextual enrichment — Automatically pulls user context (Entra ID), asset criticality (CMDB), and threat intelligence
	∙	Investigation guidance — Recommends next steps based on MITRE ATT&CK mapping and organizational playbooks via RAG
	∙	Natural language querying — Converts analyst questions into KQL (Sentinel) and SPL (Splunk) queries
	∙	Multi-platform integration — Slack/Teams bots for real-time alert delivery and interactive triage
Targeting 75% reduction in L1 analyst time-per-alert through AI augmentation while keeping humans in the loop for all response actions.
Built with lessons learned from implementing security automation at enterprise scale in financial services.
